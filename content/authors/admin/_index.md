I'm M. Reza Sadeghi, A mechanical engineer. I'm currently a master student at the Polytechnic University of Milan (Polimi). Lambert Mech's website is a way to spread out those projects that I lead and involve projects. As an engineer interested in Monitoring, Dynamics & AI, I always have tried to engage in industrial projects, learn and do my best in these fields.

It has not been a long time that since I started working on this website. So, it doesn't include enough details. I'm going to add more information soon.
