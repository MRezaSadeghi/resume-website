I am Reza Sadeghi, a mechanical engineer with a Masterâ€™s degree in energy engineering from the Polytechnic University of Milan. 
My expertise spans condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, and digital twins. My career has seen me working at ISENSE Health Monitoring and IPC Company, where I have led and participated in several industrial projects, including [TMSC](https://www.lambertmech.ir/project/pmdc/) and TFM monitoring.

I have a deep passion for research, which has been the driving force behind my work. Through Lambert Mech, I aim to share my experiences and explore fascinating topics within the field. This website is a growing project, and I am dedicated to enhancing it with more detailed content as I find the time.

You can see an overview of my previous projects from [here](https://www.lambertmech.ir/uploads/Project-Overview-2.png).
