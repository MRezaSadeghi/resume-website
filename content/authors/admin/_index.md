My name is Reza Sadeghi, and I am a BSc student in Mechanical Engineering at Iran University of Science & Technology (IUST). I work as a freelancer engineer. Also since three years ago, I have worked at NIGTS as a research assistant.

It has not been a long time that since I started working on this web page. So, it is not completed yet.
