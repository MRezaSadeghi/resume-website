Laboratory reactors are essential equipment, especially in chemical laboratories. Ava Polymer Company ordered this project and wanted to mix target substances more accurately. One of the alternatives for this device is the IKA instrument which was not affordable, and also the features of their target device were not the same as what they wanted.

IKA similar reactors cost more than 11000 Euro while in this situation I have built the similar one with some weaker features with less than 100 Euro.

When it comes to its features, this device, which I call AP12, is able to rotate almost 300rpm and apply more than 15 Ncm. The controller is used for this device is the PID controller, and it allows AP12 to adjust its speed properly.

The AP12 indicates the desired speed, actual speed, and torque in real-time and by connecting to the computer, the user will be able to monitor the process of mixing.
