# Pressure Mat
Pressure Mat is an under development industrial measurement device to evaluate the force distribution of various parts. In this system, tools and components set on the sensor pad and the designed software shows the force distribution of the tool.

The main use of this device is for ergonomic research and developing more compatible tools for human body. The picture below shows the software that is already developed and customized for ergonomic purposes. But the sensor configuration is still under development.

You can watch the working prototype of the device from this link on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/hKJCrB40PDo?feature=share).
