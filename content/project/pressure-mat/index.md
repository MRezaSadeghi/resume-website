# Pressure Mat
Project Overview:
Pressure Mat is an industrial measurement device under development designed to evaluate the force distribution across various parts. This system involves placing tools and components on a sensor pad, with specialized software displaying the force distribution of the tool.

Applications:
The primary application of this device is in ergonomic research, founded by [IPC Co](http://ipcweld.com/), aimed at developing tools that are more compatible with the human body. The software, as shown in the image below, has already been developed and customized for ergonomic purposes, though the sensor configuration is still being refined.

Demonstration:
You can watch a working prototype of the Pressure Mat device [here on YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/hKJCrB40PDo).
